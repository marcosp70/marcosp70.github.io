## A little bit about me

🧑🏽‍💻 I'm a Computer Engineering student at CEFET-MG in Brazil.

💻 I am currently a research intern at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a> in Bochum, Germany, working under the supervision of <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yixin Zou</a>. My work focuses on human-centered security and privacy, with a particular emphasis on <b>analyzing dark patterns in online gambling platforms</b>. I investigate how UX/UI design manipulates user behavior by comparing deceptive interface strategies across different websites.


🛫 I was awarded a scholarship to study cybersecurity for one year in the U.S. through an <a href="https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/community-college-initiative-program" target="_blank">academic exchange program</a> sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. During my time at Northern Virginia Community College, I graduated with honors (summa cum laude) and achieved a GPA of 4.0.

🔬 My research interests are in topics related to security, privacy, and HCI, as combating cybergrooming, dark patterns, cybercrimes, and penetration testing.

📚 I recently wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05727" target="_blank">systematic review</a> about cybergrooming and its challenges with other researchers from <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/jicho/index.html" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>.

👾 I am passionate about participating in CTFs and hackathons. I also have founded and was the president of CyberForce NOVA, a cybersecurity student club at NOVA, where we organized events and raise cybersecurity awareness.
