<p style="color: red;">I am currently seeking research internship opportunities in the cybersecurity field, particularly in security and privacy topics. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to <a href="mailto:marcos.silva@aluno.cefetmg.br" style="color: red;">email me</a> directly!</p>

## A little bit about me

🧑🏽‍💻 I'm a Computer Engineering student at CEFET-MG in Brazil.

🛫 I was awarded a scholarship to study cybersecurity for one year in the U.S. through an <a href="https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/community-college-initiative-program" target="_blank">academic exchange program</a> sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. During my time at Northern Virginia Community College, I graduated with honors (summa cum laude) and achieved a perfect GPA of 4.0.

🔬 My research interests are in topics related to security and privacy, as combating cybergrooming, network security, and penetration testing in general.

📚 I recently wrote a systemetic review about cybergrooming and its challenges with other researchers from <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/jicho/index.html" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>.

👾 I am passionate about participating in CTFs and hackathons. I also have co-founded and was the president of CyberForce NOVA, a cybersecurity student club at NOVA, where we organized events and raise cybersecurity awareness.
