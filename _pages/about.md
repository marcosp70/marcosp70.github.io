## A little bit about me

🧑🏽‍💻 I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student at CEFET-MG (Brazil), passionate about human-centered security and privacy.

💻 I recently completed a research internship at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a> in Bochum, Germany, where I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yixin Zou</a>. My research focused on human-centered security and privacy, analyzing the life cycle of online gambling addiction through personal testimonies to identify deceptive design patterns that manipulate users across regulated and unregulated platforms.

🛫 I was awarded a one-year U.S. Department of State scholarship to study cybersecurity at Northern Virginia Community College through the <a href="https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/community-college-initiative-program" target="_blank">Community College Initiative Program (CCI)</a>, where I graduated summa cum laude with a 4.0 GPA.

📚 I’m the second author of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05727" target="_blank">systematic review</a> on cybergrooming with researchers from <a href="https://qizhangvtech.github.io/RYLAI-Website/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>, and I contributed to an <strong>international study</strong> on security and privacy advice across nine Majority World countries (to appear at <em>IEEE S&P 2026</em>), coordinating data collection in Brazil.

👾 I’m passionate about CTFs, hackathons, and collaborative research. I founded and served as president of CyberForce NOVA, a cybersecurity student club at NOVA, where I helped organize events and promote cybersecurity awareness.
<!-- 👾 I’m also the founder of <a href="http://nextgenresearchers.com/" target="_blank"><strong>NextGen Researchers</strong></a>, helping undergraduates explore international research opportunities and connect with mentors worldwide. Previously, I founded CyberForce NOVA, a cybersecurity club at NOVA, where I led events and hackathons to promote cybersecurity awareness. -->
